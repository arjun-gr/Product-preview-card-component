### What I learned

I struggled alot making it responsive, As I've learned about responsive design, I now understand the challenges involved in creating a website or web application that can adapt and display content effectively across different devices and screen sizes. Specifically, I've learned about the importance of managing styles and design elements to ensure consistency across devices and explicitly mentioning the styles used for the desktop version of the website in the mobile version. Overall, I now have a better understanding of the importance of responsive design in delivering a positive user experience across different devices and screen sizes, and the difficulties involved in implementing it effectively.
